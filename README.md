## Summary
In my Tableau, I have created some worksheets and merged them into a single sheet named as Dashboard. This Dashboard represents the Profit Trends, Sales, Return for various category and sub-category

The visualization that is used are:
- Profit Trend from 2011-2014
- Sales and Return
- Map showing the Shipping Cost by Country
- Distribution of Sales, Profit, Discounts, adn Shipping Cost by Category and Sub-categories.

And I also created a Story based on the same worksheets as the Dashboard.
